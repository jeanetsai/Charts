01.01.What is a product manager
responsible for the product
intersection:engineering, design, UX

01.02.What is a product
product team/feature team
depending on the business model

01.03.Three different types of product manager roles
1. Internal PMs
(internal tools)
2. Consumer PMs
(maximize usage, A/B testing, user testing)
Facebook/Twitter
3. Business to business PMs
(SAAS/Software As A Service PMs)
Oracle/Salesforce

stakeholders: 包含顧客在內的利益相關人

01.04.How to think about the type of PM you want to be
1. Internal PM:
Great intro role
Integrate with other systems
Project management
Less risk
Small num of users

2. SAAS/B2B
Good intro role
Small num of users
Flexible and creative
Tight deadlines
One or very few platforms

3. B2C
Uncertainty
Challenging
MIllions or users
Multiple platforms
Can lose company $$
Extensive user testing

01.05.Product vs. Project management
Product manager:
success for the product
Goals, KPIs, metrices

Project management:
responsible for accomplishing a project
timeline & budget

01.06.A day in the life
check emails and tech news
metrice dashboard
team standup meeting
meeting about problems/feedbacks
write specs, tickets, user stories for upcoming features
test latest mobile release
educate newbies

01.07.Why product management is awesome
challenging

01.08.Hooray for free stuff
slack chat

02.09.The four major phases of the product lifecycle
Introduction=>growth=>maturity=>decline

02.10.Product lifecycle phases Real-world examples
Growth:
Google trend growing
Mature:
Twitter
Decline:
selling business

02.11.Product development process/lifecycle
1. conceive: collect user problems, brainstorm solutions
2. plan: do market research 
3. develop: write features, timelines, requirements, MVP
4. iterate: A/B test
5. launch
6. steady state
7. maintain or kill

02.12.Getting deeper into the product development process
4. iterate:
Get feedback=>
5. launch: legal/marketing/sales team
6. steady state: collecting metrices
7. maintain or kill: ROI (return of investment)

02.13.What is Lean Product Development
An intelligent way where I'm not using the resources until I know I adctually have to

02.14.What is Agile
Lean mindset
Develop the first 2-5 features (most important)

02.15.What is Scrum and how does it work
Agile philosophy
1. the sprint planning meeting
decide the most impoartant features
generate tickets (2-3 weeks)
2. using tickets
sprint backlog=>inprogress=>done
3. daily standup meetings
10-15m 報告進度之每日快速 meeting
4. retrospective meetings
what went well? what didn't go well?
any questions they have?

02.16.What is Kanban and how does it work
Agile philosophy
TO DO=>In Progress=>Done
does not use sprint
no sprint backlog, only product backlog
doesn't prescribe any particular meeting types
only a certain num of items can be in progress at one time

02.17.What is Waterfall development
Develop all the features at the same time
Pretty risky

02.18.Real-world examples of Waterfall and Agile
Agile:APPs
Waterfall:OS

03.19.Introduction to ideas and user needs
Idea or Need

03.20.Where ideas come from as a PM
EMUC
E:employees
M:Metrics (how users use your product)
U:Users (user feedback)
C:Clients (B2B)

Internal PM: stakeholders
B2C PM: users, metrics, coworkers
B2B PM: employees, clients

03.21.Getting to the real user needs
What is behind this request?

03.22.Users vs. Customers
Users!=Customers
(users can be anyone using this)
(customers can be marketing director)

04.23.Market research Sizing the market
Top-down
Bottom-up

Top-down: How many total users? How much market share? based on total market size, optimistic
Bottom-up: How much sales you can capture? based on current trends, conservative

Google industry reports
compete.com and more
Google keyword tool(重要)

04.24.Introduction to finding competitors
1. Get you more users
2. Make your users happier
3. Enhance your brand

1. What they look like
2. What they are doing
3. What they offer

04.25.Find competitors as a product manager
1. capture
google for "versus"
find the problem of customers
- channel the type of user
- how do they complain about the problem

Find
- companies that are using that verbage
- individual complaints online
- search engines connects the dots
reddit, quora, answers

2. Describe what your product does
- companies using literal descriptions
- ads at the top of the search list
- google search suggestions

3. Play around with quotation marks
exact match

4. Figure out how you'll pitch it
One sentence pitch 
一句總結你的產品特色，精簡並具體

04.26.Direct, indirect, and potential competitors and their impact

4 types of competitors:
(example: pasta restaurants)
1. Direct
solve problem the same way, same customers
(same pasta restaurants nearby)
2. Indirect
solve problem different way, different target of customers
(greek food restaurants)
3. Potential
different problems, same customers
(pasta grocery store)
4. Substitute
same core problems
(pizza)

Try to be competitive to : 1
Not losing too much customers to: 2
Make sure they can't do it easily: 3
Be at least better than these: 4

04.27.The five criteria for understanding competitors

1. The product core
How good is our competitor's product team? Know how good their product core is.

2. Know the size of their user base
spotify+soundcloud=30m users
apple=1b users

04.28.The last three criteria for understanding competitors

Product Core:
1. User Base
2. Size/Product team
3. Design
4. Brand
5. Speed


04.29.Monitor competitors

Competitors
1. User Base
2. Size/Product team
3. Design
4. Brand
5. Speed

1. Funding
(crunchbase: watch how much they have raised)
2. Acquisitions
3. New features/products
(mention.com:monitor companies and email you)
(google alert)

04.30.What is a feature table
      x
------------
y|
 |
 
x: competitors & you
y: features
(Price, Feature, Reliability, Ability)
middle:簡單標記，Y/N 
 
04.31.Put together a feature table
what is important to ur customer group?

04.32.Practice building a feature table
done

04.33.What do we ultimately care about as a product manager

industry news
similar apps and general apps like fb


05.34.What is customer development
1. Discovery: the customer interview
2. Validation: whether or not it's a good idea to build (MVP)
3. Creation: development of 1st version
4. Building: iteration, improving it

1. Risk mitigation
2. Opportunity recognition

05.35.The four types of interviews

1. Exploratory interview
free form, see how customers look like. Are there certain pain points? Whether or not they would pay for it.

2. Validation interview
specific way, scientific, this is my feature, do you like it? don't bias them.

3. Satisfaction oriented interview
what should we stop doing?
what I can do to make it bettr for you?

4. Efficiency interview
how it really works, how can we improve it to make it better? How easy is it to use feature X? Is it easy to understand?

05.36.Key differences in customer development
Pre-product: potential customers, they do not know you; focus on pain points+validation; finding interviewees can be difficult

Post-product: existing customers, they know of you; focus on satisfaction, usability and pain points; finding interviewees can be easier


05.37.Who you should talk to
Pre-product:
- validation
- what should go in it?
- do ppl want it?
- is there a market?
Get at least 3 groups of ppl to talk to
Write down at least 3 types of potential customers

3 Question stud
   x
--------
y|
--------
total

x: group1, group2, group3
y: market size, pain to payment, accessibility (are they easy to reach?)

Add total: highest=potential customer

05.38.Find interviewees externally

4 places to find interviewees
1. linkedin groups
2. forums and online communities
(site:reddit.com your subject)
(Quora)
3. twitter
(looking for a home/real estate agent)
4. your competitors***(重要)
(who is liking them? who is following them? reach them)

05.39.Find interviewees internally
1. Use live chat systems
(olark; tawk.to; intercom.io)
2. Your blog
3. Power users
(active users, comment often, more invested)
4. Twitter

05.40.How to get them to talk

Cold Email Ratio:3:1
(3 ppl reached, 1 person responds)

#1: Be Short (4-7 sentences)
#2: Be Personal (mention how you found them)
#3: Be Valuable 

# Mention that you're not from sales
(I'm not from sales apartment)
# Make them feel special
(You are the only one that can help us)

05.41.Practice writing emails (重要)

(開場白自介:1-2句)
I read your blog post on ____, it was great.
I've noticed that you are struggling with X feature in our product.
I saw that you had a problem with ___. A lot of people have that problem and I'd like to help you.

I think I can help you use our product better.
I want to solve your problem.
You appear to be expert on ____, you would be able to give us valuable information.
It seems like you understand our product much better than other customers. 

(話術)
I scheduled a time.
Are you available to talk Wednesday at 11:00 AM?

(範例)
Hi Sam,

I read your article on ___ -- it was really inspiring.

I have a software company trying to improve remote medical record coding.

I'm not looking to sell anything, but since you have so much expertise with remote coding, I'd love to get your advice on our product so we don't build the wrong thing.

If you're available, I'd love to chat for just 20 minutes - Thur or Fri morning?

Thank for any help,
Justin

05.42.How to run a customer interview correctly
步驟們
1. 找出你target什麼樣的人
2. 找出candidates that match target group
3. Reach out, agree to talk
4. Interview them

討論他們的problems, needs
#1. Don't talk about your solution and product
也許她們說不出 what they want
但 what they need 更重要
#2. Don't talk about your opinions 
#3. Create a comfortable environment
Don't react negatively to feedback
#4. Don't force the conversation, guide it

萬用語句
"That's interesting. Tell me more."

隨時問以下問題
Who are your customers?
What are their habits?
When do they use your product?
Where do they need your product?
Why do they need your product?


05.43.Good questions, bad questions

The risk of bias
#1. Ask open-ended questions
不要是/否的答案，不要可以簡答的問題
#2. Don't ask binary questions
不要二分法
#3. Don't ask hypothetical questions
不要假設性的問題
#4. Don't ask leading questions
不要引導答案的問題
#5. Don't ask questions that might make them lie
不要問一些可能得不到真相的問題


05.44.Build user personas off your interviews

User Personas:
There are groups of certain users that behave in similar ways.

Interview large number of users, find a user behavior, give it a real name, give a description, give background info

05.45.Real-world examples of user persona
形塑出一個有細節的使用者 名字 長相都有

05.46.The product manager and the data diet

資訊來源
(interview是質化 我們也需要量化data)
internal feedback
user test data
online feedback
analytics stats
news
market trends
watching competitors



06.Designing and Running Experiments
實驗設計MVP
06.47.What is an MVP
MVP:Minimum Viable Product
最小可行產品, a process, not a thing
test hypotheses and assumptions, mitigate risk
MVP: <Idea validation>

Validated learning:
done in a test environment, doesn't bias customer

06.48.How do product managers think about MVPs
MVP:測試看看顧客要不要這個東西

06.49.Seven steps to running an MVP experiment

#1: Product/Solution ideation
#2: Identify Assumptions
(find the riskiest)
#3: Build hypotheses around them
#4: Establish m.c.s. (minimum criteria for success)
(what constitutes success or failure?)
#5: Pick MVP strategy+type
#6: Execute MVP experiments, iterate, evaluate
#7: 顧客要這個東西嗎? Y/N 要的話再進行 wireframe 及開發

06.50.Identify your assumptions
寫出所有假設
如果假設成真 要有什麼條件?
1. 我假設我的顧客有XYZ等問題
2. ___對我的顧客是重要的
3. ___will pay for it 會付錢
4. no satisfactory substitutes
要找出有什麼替代方案 確保競爭不是問題

07.71.Introduction to Wireframing
Low-fidelity wireframe
(not a lot of detail, not very precise)

07.72.Wireframe, Mockup, Prototype
Wireframe 軟體(重要):Balsamiq, Axure, omniGraffle(流程圖), Hotgloo, POP

Mockup軟體: PS, Sketch, Illustrator, UXpin, Axure

fidelity軟體: keynote, POP, Axure, Proto.io, Vision(好)

設計: dribbble

 Fidelity (Accuracy)
Low==================>High
wireframes=>mockup=>prototype

wireframe: lowest fidelity
mockup: include style
prototype: can do user test

注意 wireframe 不是 mockup
mockup已經有樣式的基本雛形包括字型圖片設計

07.73.Jump into Sketching
用筆畫wireframe即可
Q:what is the point of this page?
users should be able to...

07.74.Sketching out a mobile app

08.Metrics for Product Managers Defining Success and Measuring Results
08.78.Introduction to metrics
Metrics frameworks

Feedback loops:愈快得到反饋 愈容易管理

KPIs(Key Performance Indicator)~=metrics

Metrics Examples:
monthly active users
returning users
churn users
app store reviews
FB and Twitter posts

<DEFINE UR SUCCESS>

08.79.Real-life examples of metrics

Examples of metrics
Twitter:
total new users per month/week
monthly/daily active users
activated users

Engagement Metrics:
multiple logins per day
time spent
num of tweets sent
Avg num of likes, re-tweets and follows
num messages sent

Youtube:
monthly/daily active users
total new users
activated users

Engagement Metrics:
video views
average viewing time(at least 30s)

Facebook:
Engagement Metrics:
position clicks
messages sent
time spent on site
average num of likes

08.80.Metrics of all kinds
1. Growth & Activation
2. Engagement
3. Retention
4. User Happiness
5. Revenue

1. Growth & Activation
total new users
new users by source
active users

2. Engagement
behaviors match commpany goal
comments per day
watch 30s of youtube videos

3. Retention
who's coming back
returning users

4. User Happiness
customer complaints
appstore ratings
surveys
(ratings <7 = bad)

5. Revenue
LTV: Life Time Value
CAC/CCA: Cost of Customer Aquisition 
MRR: Monthly Recurring Revenue
ARR: Annualy Recurring Revenue

08.81.How to pick good metrics

公司目標: Get people to stay on the site a long time
做法:
increase comments

Exploratory metrics vs. Reporting metrics
Exploratory metrics:沒有一直匯報但一直存在的指標，例如在某個頁面就跳出去
Reporting metrics:一直在追蹤並回報的指標

What makes a good metric?
1. Understandable 好懂
(number of time they stayed or did domething, or a ratio)
2. Rate or Ratio 是個率或是比例
(Monthly Active Users / Total Users)
(Average num of night booked per person)
3. Correlation
(冰淇淋的消耗量可能跟溺水數量成正比
但是是因為是夏天 不是因為他們有關)
4. Changeable
(如果使用者很忙，可以把每天使用時間改成每周使用次數num of times per week來測量)


08.82.Using the HEART metrics framework Part 1

Happiness - How happy is ur user?
Engagement - How engatged is your user in the short tem?
Adoption - How many interested users have actually tried ur product?
Retention - How many users do you retain long term? 
Task Success - How successful are you at allowing users to perform that most valuable task?

照使用順序重新排列是
1. Adoption :最大化註冊顧客數
2. Task Success:減少跳出的顧客，增加在五分鐘內完成交易的顧客等
3. Engagement:最大化orders和order value 提供超迅速快遞等
4. Retention:最大化returned customer在一段時間內之百分比
5. Happiness:最大化顧客滿意度

Goals: What do you want to happen?
Signals: What is the actual thing we need to measure?
Metrics: A signal expressed over time. This is the thing you watch.

08.83.Using the HEART metrics framework Part 2

測量顧客滿意度的方法
Signals to track for happiness
1. App store rating
2. Track scores from NPS Survey
(Net promote score)

Signals to track for engagement
- Number of orders per customer
- Order Value

Signals to track for adoption
- 至少用APP做了一件事的顧客數
- 知道下載了APP的總人數

Signals to track for retention
- who has ordered the product?
- when did they order the product?

Signals to track for task success
- number of ppl who did not complete the order 跳出的顧客數
- Amount of time spent completing an order

Tracking metrics:
Happiness:
- app store rating over time
- what percentage of total users gave us a perfect score?

Engagement:
avg order value of all customers per day
avg number of orders the users make per day

Adoption:
(ppl had ordered at least once)
What percentage of ppl who downloaded the app successfully completed an order? (The adoption rate)

Retention rate:
Of the ppl that were here last month, did they return this month?

Task success:
Avg time it takes all users to complete their order

08.84.Using the AARRR (Pirate) metrics framework
AARRR:
- Acquisition
- Activation
- Retention
- Referral
- Revenue

Acquisition: Downloaded app

Activation: Signed up and active, did something

Retention: They come back

Referral: They refer to others, talked to their friends or shared

Revenue: Making revenue, quantify the revenue


08.85.Tracking your metrics in practice

Tools for tracking metrics:
Google Analytics
crazy egg (熱點圖 找出使用者看哪裡 很酷)
kissmetrics (要錢)
mixpanel (要錢)
optimizely (類似 Google Analytics)
segment (可以一次試超多種工具)


09.Building the Product Project Management for PMs
09.86.Introduction to epics

老闆會有一個vision
vision=>goals=>metrics
How does this vision turn into a product?

Initiatives例如:translate the product into 3 other languages
Releases放出的新features或functionality

What is an epic?
A grouping of 1 or more features or functionalities that we want to build.
或是
A piece of work that takes longer than one sprint to build.
頻率通常是
3-5 epics a quarter

Epic 範例 (類似feature): Translate the app to Spanish.
Implement photo sharing in direct messages.
Allow users to upgrade to a pro membership.
Migrate our data to a new database.

09.87.Let's get into epic specs
Epic Spec Sheet = requirement document

Epic includes:
1. Introduction(features, functionalities, marketing plans, legal requirements, wireframes)
2. Product Requirements (ex: should be translated into some languages, should be stored as blah blah datatype)
3. Design Requirements (由設計師來寫, wireframes, prototypes)
4. Engineering Requirements (由工程師來寫)

09.88.User stories and acceptance criteria
User Story:使用者使用這個功能的一連串動作故事和目標

Acceptance Criteria:
A set of conditions that a software must satisfy to be considered complete
一連串軟體必須完成的完整動作

Acceptance Criteria 範例:
Given I am a user who has successfully uploaded a photo from my computer, when I click send, the image is sent to my friend through the direct message and it appears in the chat.

09.89.Real-life examples of epics, specs, user stories, and the backlog
工具:JIRA
Backlog:待辦事項
有具體工作上spec說明書的範例

09.90.Estimations and velocity
如何估時間?
Sprint Planning Meeting
(Scoping Meeting)
與其說How long does it take?不如說
How hard is it to do this?

範例
1最簡單到5最難
有5項完成3項
計算分數story point value
5+5+5=15
Velocity=15
在一段時間內可以完成的story point=15
計算一段時間內的Average Sprint Velocity

09.91.Roadmapping
Roadmapping例如:
Q1我們做blahblah Q2我們做blahblah
因為投資人喜歡看到quarter-based maps

設立短中長期目標
Near-term, Mid-term, Long-term

09.92.Prioritization
優先權
#1:Assumption Testing
(Remove risky assumptions)
風險大的先拿掉 
投報率低低重要性的先拿掉

#2:The Buc Method
(business benefits+user benefits)-cost
利益大於成本愈多的先做

#3:Moscow Method
事情分成 Must,Could,Should,Would
必須做的先做

10.Working with People and Stakeholders
10.93.General communication skills
1. Meetings 
(send followback email)
每次開會後做個小結
2. Conference Calls
3. Emails
4. Informal Meetings

10.94.Working with engineers
Focus On Details
1. If something goes wrong it's your fault
2. When you're pitching a feature, have a good idea of where the feature will go in the future
3. Try to do the work yourself upfront before asking an engineer
4. Watch out for Tech Debt
5. Do not treat engineers like an agency 
多聽工程師意見 不是只是給需求

10.95.Working with designers
1. Give designers their creative freedom
