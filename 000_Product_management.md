01.01.What is a product manager
responsible for the product
intersection:engineering, design, UX

01.02.What is a product
product team/feature team
depending on the business model

01.03.Three different types of product manager roles
1. Internal PMs
(internal tools)
2. Consumer PMs
(maximize usage, A/B testing, user testing)
Facebook/Twitter
3. Business to business PMs
(SAAS/Software As A Service PMs)
Oracle/Salesforce

stakeholders: 包含顧客在內的利益相關人

01.04.How to think about the type of PM you want to be
1. Internal PM:
Great intro role
Integrate with other systems
Project management
Less risk
Small num of users

2. SAAS/B2B
Good intro role
Small num of users
Flexible and creative
Tight deadlines
One or very few platforms

3. B2C
Uncertainty
Challenging
MIllions or users
Multiple platforms
Can lose company $$
Extensive user testing

01.05.Product vs. Project management
Product manager:
success for the product
Goals, KPIs, metrices

Project management:
responsible for accomplishing a project
timeline & budget

01.06.A day in the life
check emails and tech news
metrice dashboard
team standup meeting
meeting about problems/feedbacks
write specs, tickets, user stories for upcoming features
test latest mobile release
educate newbies

01.07.Why product management is awesome
challenging

01.08.Hooray for free stuff
slack chat

02.09.The four major phases of the product lifecycle
Introduction=>growth=>maturity=>decline

02.10.Product lifecycle phases Real-world examples
Growth:
Google trend growing
Mature:
Twitter
Decline:
selling business

02.11.Product development process/lifecycle
1. conceive: collect user problems, brainstorm solutions
2. plan: do market research 
3. develop: write features, timelines, requirements, MVP
4. iterate: A/B test
5. launch
6. steady state
7. maintain or kill

02.12.Getting deeper into the product development process
4. iterate:
Get feedback=>
5. launch: legal/marketing/sales team
6. steady state: collecting metrices
7. maintain or kill: ROI (return of investment)

02.13.What is Lean Product Development
An intelligent way where I'm not using the resources until I know I adctually have to

02.14.What is Agile
Lean mindset
Develop the first 2-5 features (most important)

02.15.What is Scrum and how does it work
Agile philosophy
1. the sprint planning meeting
decide the most impoartant features
generate tickets (2-3 weeks)
2. using tickets
sprint backlog=>inprogress=>done
3. daily standup meetings
10-15m 報告進度之每日快速 meeting
4. retrospective meetings
what went well? what didn't go well?
any questions they have?

02.16.What is Kanban and how does it work
Agile philosophy
TO DO=>In Progress=>Done
does not use sprint
no sprint backlog, only product backlog
doesn't prescribe any particular meeting types
only a certain num of items can be in progress at one time

02.17.What is Waterfall development
Develop all the features at the same time
Pretty risky

02.18.Real-world examples of Waterfall and Agile
Agile:APPs
Waterfall:OS

03.19.Introduction to ideas and user needs
Idea or Need

03.20.Where ideas come from as a PM
EMUC
E:employees
M:Metrics (how users use your product)
U:Users (user feedback)
C:Clients (B2B)

Internal PM: stakeholders
B2C PM: users, metrics, coworkers
B2B PM: employees, clients

03.21.Getting to the real user needs
What is behind this request?

03.22.Users vs. Customers
Users!=Customers
(users can be anyone using this)
(customers can be marketing director)

04.23.Market research Sizing the market
Top-down
Bottom-up

Top-down: How many total users? How much market share? based on total market size, optimistic
Bottom-up: How much sales you can capture? based on current trends, conservative

Google industry reports
compete.com and more
Google keyword tool(重要)

04.24.Introduction to finding competitors
1. Get you more users
2. Make your users happier
3. Enhance your brand

1. What they look like
2. What they are doing
3. What they offer

04.25.Find competitors as a product manager
1. capture
google for "versus"
find the problem of customers
- channel the type of user
- how do they complain about the problem

Find
- companies that are using that verbage
- individual complaints online
- search engines connects the dots
reddit, quora, answers

2. Describe what your product does
- companies using literal descriptions
- ads at the top of the search list
- google search suggestions

3. Play around with quotation marks
exact match

4. Figure out how you'll pitch it
One sentence pitch 
一句總結你的產品特色，精簡並具體

04.26.Direct, indirect, and potential competitors and their impact

4 types of competitors:
(example: pasta restaurants)
1. Direct
solve problem the same way, same customers
(same pasta restaurants nearby)
2. Indirect
solve problem different way, different target of customers
(greek food restaurants)
3. Potential
different problems, same customers
(pasta grocery store)
4. Substitute
same core problems
(pizza)

Try to be competitive to : 1
Not losing too much customers to: 2
Make sure they can't do it easily: 3
Be at least better than these: 4

04.27.The five criteria for understanding competitors

1. The product core
How good is our competitor's product team? Know how good their product core is.

2. Know the size of their user base
spotify+soundcloud=30m users
apple=1b users

04.28.The last three criteria for understanding competitors

Product Core:
1. User Base
2. Size/Product team
3. Design
4. Brand
5. Speed


04.29.Monitor competitors

Competitors

2. Size/Product team
3. Design
4. Brand
5. Speed

1. Funding
(crunchbase: watch how much they have raised)
2. Acquisitions
3. New features/products
(mention.com:monitor companies and email you)
(google alert)

04.30.What is a feature table
      x
------------
y|
 |
 
x: competitors & you
y: features
(Price, Feature, Reliability, Ability)
middle:簡單標記，Y/N 
 
04.31.Put together a feature table
what is important to ur customer group?

04.32.Practice building a feature table
done

04.33.What do we ultimately care about as a product manager

industry news
similar apps and general apps like fb


05.34.What is customer development
1. Discovery: the customer interview
2. Validation: whether or not it's a good idea to build (MVP)
3. Creation: development of 1st version
4. Building: iteration, improving it

1. Risk mitigation
2. Opportunity recognition

05.35.The four types of interviews

1. Exploratory interview
free form, see how customers look like. Are there certain pain points? Whether or not they would pay for it.

2. Validation interview
specific way, scientific, this is my feature, do you like it? don't bias them.

3. Satisfaction oriented interview
what should we stop doing?
what I can do to make it bettr for you?

4. Efficiency interview
how it really works, how can we improve it to make it better? How easy is it to use feature X? Is it easy to understand?

05.36.Key differences in customer development
Pre-product: potential customers, they do not know you; focus on pain points+validation; finding interviewees can be difficult

Post-product: existing customers, they know of you; focus on satisfaction, usability and pain points; finding interviewees can be easier


05.37.Who you should talk to
Pre-product:
- validation
- what should go in it?
- do ppl want it?
- is there a market?
Get at least 3 groups of ppl to talk to
Write down at least 3 types of potential customers

3 Question stud
   x
--------
y|
--------
total

x: group1, group2, group3
y: market size, pain to payment, accessibility (are they easy to reach?)

Add total: highest=potential customer

05.38.Find interviewees externally

4 places to find interviewees
1. linkedin groups
2. forums and online communities
(site:reddit.com your subject)
(Quora)
3. twitter
(looking for a home/real estate agent)
4. your competitors***(重要)
(who is liking them? who is following them? reach them)

05.39.Find interviewees internally
1. Use live chat systems
(olark; tawk.to; intercom.io)
