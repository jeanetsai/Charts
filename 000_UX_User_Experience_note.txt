03 2 A Model of Psychology and Interaction Design
001 Why psychology
Discover (study and insights)
Craft (design and prototype)
Deliver (develop and measure)
Improve (iterate and optimize)

<Discover>
identify objective
quantitative data
time. num of errors
Measure, observe, ask
Frame the problem

<Craft>
design
prototype
iterate

002 Introducing the interaction design model

perceive
predict
interact
feedback
learn
practice

003 Context
<who is the person>
description, experience, expectations, indivisual or group
<where when>
location, situation, time, public or private, be able to focus or interrupted
<what objects and how>
objects, devices, tools, purpose, conjunction, alternatives, efficacy (efficient or not)

Context influences expectations and behavior

Personas, stories, scenarios, and journeys help us describe context

The best designs emerge when we understand the bigger picture in a broader context over time


004 Goals
Productivity / Creativity & Play
1. objectives
outcomes/achievements/end states
2. importance
value/essential/necessary/optional/elective
3. urgency
priority/critical/compelling/timing

Productivity tools: focus, efficacy, efficiency
Games: exploration, achievement, competition

04 3 Introductory Psychology
001 Sensation
Perception (vision, hearing, touch, proprioception)
we only pay attention to a small, select amount

<vision>
color vision
yellow/blue
red/green
Use multiple cues, never use color alone
Use Labels, shapes, images
No color combinations

<Hearing>
Sound alone is not enough
visual messages+vibrations

<Touch>
movement, pressure
temperation, vibration, texture, pressure

<Haptic Perception>
Active exploration using:
size
weight
contour
surface
material
temperature
consistency/solidity

motion:tracing our fingers along contours and over the surface to sense texture, shape, and size
pressure:pressing or squesszing to sense consistency and structure
enclosure:wrapping our hands around an object to sense shape, size and weight

<Proprioception>
An internal sense providing information about the relative position and movement of our body
spatial gestures
spatial movement
shake, rotate, squeeze, gestures

002 Perception
Perception happens in our brain


<Perceptual constancy>
Environment conditions change all around us, yet we still perceive the world and the things in it with great consitency.
Shape
Lightness
Color
Distance
Size
Location
Timbre (quality of sound)

EX:different typography

<Simultaneous Contrast>
same color looks different in different backgounds

003 Gestalt principles[USEFUL!!!]
<Phi Effect>
a series of blinking lights
creates the illusion of motion

<Gestalt>
Gestalt = shape or form
We perceive the world as meaningful and complete 
objects, not a series of independent parts

<Gestalt Laws>
Figure-ground
Simplicity
Proximity
Similarity
Common fate
Closure
Continuity
Symmetry

[Figure-ground]
[Simplicity]
[Proximity] nearby perceived as a group
[Similarity] similar belongs together
[common fate] objects move together belongs together

004 Affordances
<Affordances>
Physical chars of objects make possible what we are able to do
We recognize when we are able to interact
Affordances are relative to the indivisual and their ability to interact
Affordance do not require conscious attention and thought
Affordances arise from our intrinsic understanding of our physical relationship with the world around us

<Perceived Affordances>
Perceived affordances arise when a digital representation has similarities with an actual physical object
A physical button has affordances, a digital interface button has erceived affordances

以模擬的面板模擬3D button
<Perceived affordances and digital interfaces>
Shadows
Perspective
Overlap or layered
Blur (for distance)
Scale (for distance)

<Easier with Multiple Signals>
Interactions are easier to learn when we include multiple signals, including perceived affordances

005 Motivation
<Motivation>
Motivation is the force that initiates, sustains, and directs behavior
People
Situation
Needs
Objective
Importance
Urgency

<Locus of control>
External > Extrinsic motivation
Internal > Intrinsic motivation
Try to understand what will intrinsically motivate people,
and do not rely on rewards alone

Theory1
<Achievement>Problem solving and learning
<Affiliation>Social relationships
<Power>Influencing others

Theory2
<Expectancy>
If i put forth the effort necessary, then I will perform well
<Instrumentality>
If I perform well, then I will receive an outcome
<Valence>
If I value the outcome, then I will be motivated to put forth the effort necessary

<Low Motivation Occurs When>
We expect to fail or perform poorly
There will be no outcome, or the outcome is independent of our effort
We do not value the outcome or results

Theory3
<Existence>basic survival and safety
<Relatedness>social relationships
<Growth>personal development and self-esteem

006 Attention and memory
<Factors of Cognition>
[Attention]
[Cognitive load]
[Memory]Encoding, recall, recognition
[Pattern recognition]
[Reasoning and logic]problem-solving, decision-making
[Concept formation]
Associations, mental models

<3 stages of memory>
[Sensory store]
[Working]
[Long-term]

<Long-term Memory Systems>
[Declaraive]
Things we know (knowledge)
Semantic - facts
Episodic - events
Easy to state and describe information we know
[Procedural]
Things we can do (skills)
Easier to show how to perform an action or task than to describe how to do it

<How to retrieve info>
[Recall]retrieve it
[Recognition][easier]make a selection from a set of choices by comparing what we perceive with what we remember

[Recognition is easier]
Show info and functionality when it is needed
Put information and functionality where people expect to find it
Present information in meaningful ways

[Visual Memory is Powerful]
Memory for images is better than our memory for words

<Pattern Recognition>
The tendency (and ability) see patterns and to make connections between similar and related things

007 Reasoning and logic
<Problem-solving methods>
[Trial-and-error]
Each step should move us closer to the solution or our goals
[Difference reduction]
[Subgoal decomposition]
Breaks down to smaller manageable steps
[Analogy]Recognize that a new problem is similar to previously solved problem and apply the same methods
[Transformation]Solve the problem by transforming it into another format or structure that clarifies the problem
[Algorithms and heuristics]
heuristics: rough estimate to the value

<Decision-making>
[Rational]
Compare and evaluate all options. Do
not asuume people are rational. Incorrect info, social pressure and strong emotions can mislead decisions.
[Optimal]Make choices that maximize gains and minimize losses
[Satisficing]Consider key info and make a decision that is "good enough."
[Pain vs. value]Compare the value of the goal or outcome to the effor necessary to achieve it and choose options where the value is greater than the effort. Z>B or B>Z

008 Mental models
<Mental Models>
Out thoughts and expectations about how things work in the real world. They influence our behavior, decisions, and attitudes

<Types of Models>
[Mental model]
Prior exp and expectations of how a product whould work, reside in the minds of the ppl who will use the product
[Conceptual model]
Prior exps, plans, and design intents for how a product should work, reside in the minds of the product creators
[System model]
How the product actually works, which is often more complicated than what people interact with, because interfaces are designed to conceal the complexity

<Good mental models simplify>
We must understand how something really works (the system model) so that we can design a product (the conceptual model) that is easy for people to understand and use (the mental model)

009 Cognitive load
<Information Overload>

<Cognitive Friction>
Slows us down
When things change unexpectedly
When things look familiar but work in different ways

<Cohesiveness reduces cognitive friction>

<Reducing Cognitive Load>
Base smart defaults on context, usage patterns, and past behavior
Only use smart defaults when they are likely to be correct
Make smart defaults easy to change

<Reducing Cognitive Friction>
Understand the mental models
Provide meaningful information
Keep people focused on the outcome or goal
Simplify the interactions
Provide help and instructions

010 Theories of emotion
<Emotions>
Subjective experiences are difficult to define and measure
Emotions may vary by individual, context, and culture
The absence of negative exps is not enough to create positive emotions
增加正向經驗 減少負向經驗

<multiple Theories of Emotion>
Anger
Disgust
Fear
Sadness
Happiness
Surprise

Happy + surprise = joy
Anger + fear = frustration

011 Designing for delight
<Delight>
Surprise only works once

<Levels of Delight>
[Surface delight]beautiful design, great voices and tones...
comes from the chars of the product 
we perceive and experiences
[Deep delight]emerges when products are frictionless, effortless, easy and meaningful
=>Strive to create products that are deeply delightful

<Creating Delight>
[Pleasure] arises from humor, uniqueness, personality, beauty, simplicity, and the ability to anticipate needs
[Flow] arises from ease of use, efficiency, immersiveness, automation, and when ppl feel empowred
[Meaning] creates delight with purpose, value, connectedness, relevance, and personal engagement with compassion and care

<Hierarchy of product quality>
pleasurable (Delight)
Ease of Use
Reliable & Dependable
Functional

Delight should be on par with functionaliry, reliability, and usability

012 Empathy

[Empathy] is the ability to understand and identify with another person's context, emotions, goals, and motivations

[Fostering Empathy]
Spend time with the ppl who use your product
Develop good listening and observation skills
Collect objective data about how ur product is actually being used
Remove yourself from the product decisions
Practice with your colleagues and help each other improve
Employ user-centered design methods

013 Learning behaviors
[Stimulus] is a signals
[Response] is a behavior
[Consequence] is an outcome
[Conditioning] is learning
[Association] is connecting

<3 Theories of Learned Behavior>
[Classical Conditioning]
We learn to assiciate exps that occur together in space and/or time
[Operant Conditioning]
We learn to behave to seek reward and avoid punishment
[Observational Learning]
We learn by observing others then imitating them

014 Classical conditioning
Social network 條件制約

015 Operant conditioning
[=instrumental conditioning]
Behaviors are performed in exchange for rewards

<Operant conditioning>
A stimulus (or signal) indicates that a behavior may be performed
Once the behavior is performed, an outcome (or consequence) results

Signal => Behavior => Outcome/Rewards/Punishment
see messy room=>clean=>get rewards

Avoid punishment
Use Reinforcement

Reinforcement Schedules
Fixed time: every 2 hours
Fixed count: every 10 times
Variable: about 2 or 3 hours
Variable: about 10-20 times

Not all rewards have the same value for everyone

[Selecting Rewards]
Attention, recognition, and praise are social reinforcers
Money, credits, and points are financial reinforcers

016 Social learning theory
We may learn from watching others or the environment around us

<Three types of modeling>
[Live models]mentorship, a person 
demonstrates the desired behavior,
we observe directly, then we
imitate their behavior
[Direct instruction]They tell us what to do, A person describes the desired behavior in detail and provices instructions to us about how to do it, then we perform the behavior as described
[Symbolic instruction]The model is not a person but instruction materials, Modelling occurs through media, including the web, written and/or illustrated info, video, and audio. We view the media then perform the behavior as instructed

017 Using learned behavior
Past exps influence future behavior


05 4 The Interaction Design Model
001 Overview of the IxD model

Context>Goals>productivity+creativity>perception+emotion+motivation+cognition>Behavior

002 Perceive
Remember=>Perceive>Predict>Interact>
Feedback>Learn>Practice>Perceive...

Perceive 要告訴使用者哪裡可以互動
button design, motion, shadows ...

003 Predict
High confidence+High perceivability=Interact
High confidence+Low perceivability=Moderate but trial and error
High confidence+High perceivability=Low probability of interaction
High confidence+High perceivability=Abandon

<Deciding among Options>
When there are different ways to complete a task, people decide based on:
Context
Goal
Prior Experience
Perceivability
Confidence

004 Feedback
<Three Stages of Feedback>
[Interaction acknowledged]
An immediate response to a person's interaction and request. The product acknowledges that they have done something
[Request in progress] Interim feedback, indicate progress or status
[Results of interaction] The actual result or output of the product in response to a person's request

<Initial Feedback>
Techniques to acknowledge interactions:
Hovers, rollovers, and down states
Transitions for size, rotation, and location
Modal layers and dialogs appear or disappear
Sound and vibration

<Interim feedback>
Techniques to indicate status and progress:
De-activated states with status messages (e.g., a button that changes from "Get file" to "downloading")
Progress indicators for time, amount, or simply ongoing
(e.g., loading bar, % complete, time remaining, or just a continuous spinner)

<Final Feedback>
Final feedback takes many forms and varies based on the product and the person's request
Navigate to a new page or screen
Modal layers and dialogs
Update content on the current page
Control media playback
Control game play
Error messages

<Ambient feedback>
Subtle, continuous changes to the interface that provide useful information at a glance
It usually conveys information about a single variable in a simple way

<Anticipatory feedback>
Information is provided before a person interacts
to help them understand what the outcomes may be
Improves the accuracy of predictions
Helps people avoid interactions that are not likely to help them achieve their goals

<Making meaning of feedback>
Is the outcome meaningful?
Does the outcome match the prediction?
Does the outcome help the person get closer to the goal?

<Emotions feedback button/survey>

005 Learn
<Learning to interact>
[Association] We assiciate things that occur together in space and time
[Reinforcement] Good outcomes rewards interaction, bad outcomes decrease interaction
[Observation] We imitate the behavior of other ppl, we learn from examples, tutorials, and videos

<Intuitive Design>
Only need to use it once to learn
"intuitive" means that it is easy to perceive, accurately predict, interact with, learn from meaningful feedback, and remember how to use a product with just a single experience

<What might go wrong?>
[Complexity] require more practice and effort to learn
[Infrequent use] fewer opportunities for practice
[Insufficient value] neet few needs, provide little value
[Insufficient effort] require high effort and long periods of practice

006 Remember
<Consistency and Cohesiveness>
[Identifiably analogous]
products and exp that are similar makes it easier to apply our past exp
[Internal consistency]
When the interface and interactions are the same within the product, it is easier for us to learn and remember how to use different features of the same product
[External consistency]
When an interface and interactions are similar across different products, it is easier for us to transfer what we learned elsewhere to a new product
[Generalization]
When there are enough shared interface characteristics and ppl have similar context and goals, the will generalize their past exp and apply it to the new situation
[Discrimination]
When an interface is sufficiently different and ppl have different context and goals, they are able to differentiate between what they did in the past and what we are trying to do now, so they will interact in a different way
[Cohesiveness]
A cohesive exp has recognizably related interface elements and interactions that collectively form a product

<What might go wrong?>
[Mismatch] failure to recognize that a new product is similar to something they already know how to use or do. 不要為不同而不同
[Confusion] Mistakenly interact as if a product is similar to a prior exp when it is actually different
不要 design in unexpected ways 
[Forgetting]
Design products with strong signals and cues and meaningful content and flows to facilitate remembering

06 5 Interaction Design
001 Dimensions of interaction design
<Interaction Design>
[Dimensions] of focus
[Models] of methods and processes
Buiding [principles]

<Five Dimensions of IxD>
[Words (content)] should be easy to understand
[Visual representations]
Diagrams, illustrations, graphics and even typographic styles and media to clarify data and concepts
[Physical objects or space]
The physical hardware, such as keyboard, mouse, or smartphone, and the space necessary to use it effectively
[Time] The time during which ppl interact with the product and how they might measure their progress
[Behavior] The actions, reactions, and emotions ppl have when interacting with a product

2. Define a product's purpose based on ppl's needs and goals
3. Craft experiences for efficient flow
4. Deliver meaningful, relevant, and valuable experiences
5. Ensure products easy to use, learn, and remember
6. Always respect and protect the ppl who use our products and services

003 Levels of design Structure

[Structure]>Flow>Interface

<Supports>
Meaningfulness
Comprehension
Predictability
Confidence

<Structure has 3 levels>
[Product] Overall architechture defines all of their sections, the purpose of each, and the navigation and connections among them
[Screen]What belongs on each page or screen and where should it appear? What appears on all or multiple screens?
Placement can communicate importance, relationships, and functionality
[Component]
Define the content and interactivity of indivisual elements on the screen

004 Levels of design Flow

Structure>[Flow]>Interface

<Flow happends on 3 levels>
[Multi-channel ecosystem]
Many products and services are used in conjunction with others. How does the product fit into a larger ecosystem?
Banking is multi-channel
[Product] Identify the paths through the product and all of the steps and actions necessary to complete tasks
[Components] Identify and describe the various states of interactive screens and components


005 Levels of design Interface
Structure>Flow>[Interface]

<Microinteractions>
Motion
Sound
Haptics

006 Design patterns
<Design Patterns>
Design patterns are recurring, re-usable, optimal solutions to common design problems

<We have design patterns for>
[Structure]
[Flow]
[Interface]

<Good Design Patterns>
Familiar, recognizable, and easy to apply correctly
Optimal, effective, and efficient
Relevant in the context and to the goals
Effortless and easy to use with minimal work

Do something diffeerently simply because it is better

007 Anti-patterns

<Anti-patterns>
Just because a solution or pattern is common does not mean it is good or best

<Detect and Avoid Anti-patterns>
[Seek analogous patterns]
Select relevant and analogous patterns for the same underlying problem and similar contexts, not just superficially similar patterns
[Make no assumptions] Just because a pattern is common does not mean it is the best way to interact or is the best path to a goal
[Explore multiple options] Identify and compare multiple possible solutions for viability, feasibility, and optimality
[Evaluate and study] Critically review and test the interface and interactions to ensure they work well and are aligned with ppl's needs and expectations

009 Navigation structure
<Navigation>
Navigation is the movement from place to place or state to state within a product


010 Navigation systems
<Navigation systems>
[Hierarchical] when there are multiple levels
[Hub and spoke] there is a central hub from which to explore and browse, there are often several independent sections. e.g., news website
[Adaptive]e.g., blogs 後台
[Stream] Where there is a steady stream of new content or posts. e.g., social networks, Facebook
[Search, sort, and filter] e.g., search engines
[Interactive or gestural] hover, long press or swipe gesture
[Content links] Links in the content of a page or screen are a form of contextually relevant navigation. e.g., image or video thumbnail links
[Hybrid] Mixes different types of navigation into a single system. e.g., twitter

<Findability vs. Discoverability>
[Findability] When a person knows in advance that something is or should be within the product, it should be easy for them to find when they need it
[Discoverability] When a person does not know in advance that something exists and is available within the product, it should be easy for them to discover by interacting

011 Content

<Designing with Text>
[Readability] The ease with which a reader can understand written text
[Scanning] Organize text to facilitate scanning to help people focus their attention and find what they need
[Typography] Font size, line height, line length. 45-75 chars limit

[Symbols, icons, and colors]
[Culturally appropriate text and graphics]
[Varying legal requirements]

012 Inputs
<Bi-directional Data Flow>

<Direct vs. Indirect Action>

<Interaction Gap>
The more distance or time between the point of interaction and the result or reaction, the more difficult it may be to control

<Direct interaction>
Strive to make interacitons as direct and immediate as possible


013 Gestures

<Gestures>

[Drag]
[Swipe]
[Fllick]
[Pinch]
[Spread]

<Whole device gestures>
[Orient]
[Shake]
[Flip]

<Signals and Cues>
Gestures are invicible
Demos and instructinos can show

Multi-touch gestures are difficult to discover

"What Did I Just Do?"
Gestures leave no trace, so only apply it on unimportant purpose
Accidential gestures may go unnoticed and may be difficult to undo

<Standardization of Gestures>
Use arbitrary and complex gestures with caution
Instructions, demos, and hints are often necessary
Use clear signals and cues to indicate that gestures may be used
Use gestures consistently and in familiar ways whenever possible

014 Voice

<Signals and Cues for Voice>
Some we rely on are...
1. Presence of the device
2. Lights
3. Sounds

<Principle for Voice Interaction>
[Reveal] Help ppl understand when voice interaction is available and ready
[Guide] Help ppl understand what the can say and the actions the product can perform for them
[Repeat] Repeat the request and provide options and examples when asking for clarification
[Tell] State the request when delivering results or performing actions on their behalf
[Respect] Be polite, friendly, concise, considerate, and unobtrusive

<We need to design for>

016 Defining microinteractions

<Microinteractions>
Microinteractions are the small, nuanced reactions of a product that provide infomation and feedback
例如 愛心按鈕 提供小回饋


<Microinteractions>
[Triggers] e.g., alarm clock. Signal or cue that something has happened or that something will happen
[Rules] e.g., alarm clock at specific time. Determine the conditions under which microinteractions occur and define what will happen
[Feedback] e.g., immediate sound of alarm set. Verifies that the person has interacted with the product or that specific conditions have been met
[Loops and modes] e.g., alarm sound ringing. Some microinteractions repeat or loop until the person stops it or end conditions are met


017 Microinteractions Motion

<Motion>
Our brains are wired to be sensitive to motion and change
Draws attention toward something ("Look over here!")
Guides attention away to another thing ("Look over there!")

<Motions has meaning>
[Time] Progress bars. Animations and motion may communicate progress, transition, and status
[Space] Changing layers. Motion can help ppl understand spatial location and hierarchy.
[Relationship] Moving objects toward or away from each other. Connections, relationships, and associations can be clarified and highlighted
[Change]Shape, size, apprearance, and location may transform in proportion to changes in value or meaning
[Opportunity] Direction of motion & gesture. Indicate opportunities to interact, often with gestures, by mimicking the gesture with similar motion of the interactive elements on the screen

<Smooth motion>
easing, make it smooth

018 Microinteractions Sound

Can be annoying

<Sound Has Value and Purpose>
[Direct attention] Alarms. Attract and guide a person's attention to outcomes they requested or which require their response
[Provide feedback and information] Buzzing an click sounds. Provide feedback and information about the status and progress of interactions and processes
[Support brand and identity] Recognizable Apple/Microsoft sound. Sounds may be associated with a product's brand and identity



019 Microinteractions Haptics


<Haptic Feedback>
[Vibration]震動
[Force]使力的輕鬆程度
[Texture]質地

<Vibration>
[Taps on the screens] Commonl acknowledged with rapid vibrations
[Hard or long press] Indicate when a press has been long or forceful enough to trigger the interaction
[Alarms and notifications] Sound and vibration are commonly used in conjunction and increase effectiveness in environments with variable noise levels
[Gestural feedback] May be used to provide feedback during a gesture and at the end to indicate successful completion


020 Error handling

<Effective Error Messages>
1. Use natural language and never blame the person
2. Clearly describe what went wrong

<8 Golden rules of Interface Design>
1. Strive for consistency
2. Enable shortcuts for frequent actions
3. Offer informative feedback
4. Design dialogs to yield closure
5. Offer simple error handling
6. Permit eas reversal of actions
7. Support internal locus of control
8. Reduce short-term memory load

<Accessibility>
All people are able to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with products regardless of their abilities, and they can contribute equally

<Basic Accessibility>
1. Text should be structured for screen readers
2. Imagery should have descriptions
3. Videos should be captioned
4. Interfaces should be navigable and usable by multiple methods, including keyboard, mouse, touch, and voice
